# React Native with Expo

The project contains a skeleton app for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/).

Code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and app uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) for navigation.

## Setup and installation

From the [Expo installation guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/), install the following:

- Git
- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Yarn
- VS Code

Also install the [Expo Go app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-ios-and) on your iPhone or Android phone.

## Run the app

[Start the expo development server](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#starting-the-development-server) from the terminal, and [scan the QR code from the terminal output](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet) on your phone.

Make sure both your phone and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and that your computer allows inbound connections on port 19000.

## Start writing code

When you make changes to the code, the changes will automatically be reflected in Expo Go.
